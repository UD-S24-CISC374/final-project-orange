Cross The Pond is about a baby frog who is separated from its mother and is trying to find its way back to her. In order to do this, the baby frog will cross a pond by hopping on lily pads connected together. On the lines connecting each lilypad, there will be numbers. The goal of the game is for the baby frog to hop on the correct lilypads that make up the shortest path. The shortest path should be decided using Dijstra's graph searching algortihm. There are 10 different levels with increasing difficulty.

# Basic Instructions

You are playing as the baby frog who starts each level in the bottom left corner. Using Dijkstra's graph search algortihm, cross the pond by jumping on connected lilypads to get the baby frog back to its mother/
